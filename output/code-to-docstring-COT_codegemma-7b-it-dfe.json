["Adamax optimizer for TensorFlow.\n\nAdamax is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of Momentum and RMSProp. It uses a variable learning rate that decays over time, and it keeps track of the maximum gradient values seen so far for each parameter. This allows Adamax to adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on its own history of gradients.\n\nAdamax is a good choice for training deep learning models.

However, there may be other interpolation methods supported by the Keras backend. Specifying all supported methods would be more accurate.\n* **Provide a link to the Keras documentation**: The docstring currently doesn't include a link to the relevant Keras documentation. Adding a link would make it easier for users to find more information about the UpSampling2D layer.\n\nHere's an improved docstring with the suggested changes:\n\n```python\nclass UpSampling2D(Layer):\n    \"\"\"Up-samples an image by a given factor.\n\n    This layer uses the `resize_images` function from the Keras backend to perform the upsampling.\n    The layer can be used to increase the size of an image by a factor of 2, 3, or 4.\n\n    Args:\n        size: A tuple of integers specifying the upsampling factor (height, width).\n        data_format: The data format of the input images.
