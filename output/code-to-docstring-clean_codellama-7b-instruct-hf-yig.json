If it is a tuple, then the amount of padding to add to each dimension is specified separately.\n\nThe `data_format` argument specifies the format of the input data. It can be either `'channels_first'` or `'channels_last'`. If it is `'channels_first'`, then the input data is assumed to have the shape `(batch_size, channels, dim1, dim2, dim3)`. If it is `'channels_last'`, then the input data is assumed to have the shape `(batch_size, dim1, dim2, dim3, channels)`.\n\nThe `ZeroPadding3D` layer has 4 methods:\n\n* `dummy_def_1`: This method initializes the layer with the given arguments. It sets the `data_format` attribute and the `padding` attribute based on the `data_format` and `padding` arguments, respectively.\n* `dummy_def_2`: This method computes the output shape of the layer. It takes the input shape as an argument and returns the output shape.\n* `dummy_def_3`: This method applies the padding to the input data. It takes the input data as an argument and returns the padded data.\n* `dummy_def_4`: This method returns the configuration of the layer. It returns a dictionary containing the `padding` and `data_format` attributes.", "  This is a Python class with several methods and properties. The class is a transformer that takes in a dataset and performs some operations on it. The methods and properties of the class are:\n\n1. `dummy_def_1`: This method takes in a dataset `X` and a boolean parameter `force_all_finite`. It returns a tuple containing the columns of the dataset, the number of samples, and the number of features.\n2. `dummy_def_2`: This method takes in a dataset `X`, a parameter `handle_unknown`, a parameter `force_all_finite`, a parameter `return_counts`, and a parameter `return_and_ignore_missing_for_infrequent`. It returns a dictionary containing the number of samples, the number of features, and the category counts for each feature.\n3. `dummy_def_3`: This method takes in a dataset `X`, a parameter `handle_unknown`, a parameter `force_all_finite`, a parameter `warn_on_unknown`, and a parameter `ignore_category_indices`. It returns a tuple containing the encoded dataset and a mask indicating which categories are valid.\n4. `dummy_def_4`: This property returns a list of the infrequent categories for each feature.\n5. `dummy_def_5`: This method sets the `_infrequent_enabled` attribute based on the `max_categories` and `min_frequency` parameters.\n6. `dummy_def_6`: This method takes in a category count, the number of samples, and the column index, and returns the indices of the infrequent categories.\n7. `dummy_def_7`: This method takes in the number of samples, the category counts, and the missing indices, and sets the `_infrequent_indices` and `_default_to_infrequent_mappings` attributes.\n8. `dummy_def_8`: This method takes in the encoded dataset, the mask, and the ignore category indices, and updates the dataset and mask to handle infrequent categories.\n9. `dummy_def_9`: This property returns a dictionary containing the types of the input data and whether or not to allow NaN values."]
